    <h1>Alfred V. Miller, a 32 year old, black male died on 1992-05-01
in a homicide at Florence Avenue &amp; Cimarron Street in Chesterfield Square.</h1>

    <p>Alfred V. Miller, a 32-year-old black man, was fatally shot Friday, May 1, 1992, in Chesterfield Square. Miller was wounded as he rode in a car at the intersection of Florence Avenue and Cimarron Street. He was taken to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The drive-by shooting of Miller, who was wearing a body cast from a previous shooting, may have been connected to a past feud, authorities said. &#34;There was no exchange of words, no confrontation -- just the shots fired,&#34; said LAPD Det. Rosemary Sanchez. A suspect was arrested in the Miller slaying, but the district attorney&#39;s office decided that the witness&#39; identification was too shaky.</p>
