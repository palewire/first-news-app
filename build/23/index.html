    <h1>Matthew D. Haines, a 32 year old, white male died on 1992-04-30
in a homicide at Lemon Avenue &amp; Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach.</h1>

    <p>Matthew Haines, a 32-year-old white man, was beaten and shot in the head, Thursday, April 30, 1992, in Long Beach. Haines and his nephew, Scott Coleman, 26, were pulled from Haines&#39; motorcycle at the corner of Lemon Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway. Haines was beaten, kicked and fatally shot in the head. Coleman was shot but survived. In February 1993, a Superior Court jury acquitted Larry Williams, 24, Fabian Nixon, 19, and Brent Lamar Jones, 18, of murder. Instead they were found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and conspiring to assault, loot and rob. The jury said the three weren&#39;t guilty of murder because &#34;there wasn&#39;t evidence proving that the three defendants actually did shoot the victim,&#34; the forewoman said at the time. Williams and Nixon were sentenced to nearly six years in prison and ordered to pay restitution. Jones, who was a minor at the time, was sentenced to five years and eight months in the California Youth Authority and ordered to pay $5,000 to a crime victims&#39; restitution fund.</p>
