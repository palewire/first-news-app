    <h1>Imad Sharaf, a 31 year old, Black male died on 1992-05-03
in a not riot-related at San Diego Freeway &amp; San Fernando Mission Boulevard in Mission Hills.</h1>

    <p>Imad Sharaf&#39;s body was found the morning of Sunday, May 3, 1992, when firefighters answered a report of a brush fire near the on-ramp to the 405 Freeway at San Fernando Mission Boulevard in Mission Hills. At first, Sharaf, a Granada Hills resident who emigrated from Jordan three years ago, was listed as a riot victim. Detectives now believe that he was drugged before he was set ablaze and that the fire may have been an attempt to make the slaying appear riot-related. Police said that Sharaf, who was a photo lab technician, had been doused with a flammable substance and set afire.</p>
