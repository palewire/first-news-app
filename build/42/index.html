    <h1>Charles W. Orebo, a 21 year old, Black male died on 1992-05-01
in a officer involved shooting at Florence Avenue &amp; Flower Street in Florence.</h1>

    <p>Charles Orebo, a 21-year-old black man, was shot and killed Friday, May 1, 1992, near the intersection of Florence Avenue and Flower Street in Florence. Charles &#34;Sticks&#34; Orebo and two friends, Andre Webb and Lavelle &#34;Frog&#34; Williams were driving toward a South Los Angeles house where Webb planned to spend the night. Near Florence Avenue and the 110 Freeway, Orebo tried to make a lane change, nearly cutting off a car behind him. The other driver honked and pulled alongside at a stoplight. Williams drew a handgun, loaded it and pointed it past Orebo toward the other driver, an LAPD officer who was out of uniform and en route to work. &#34;The guy looked at us,&#34; Webb said, &#34;and he jumped like he was in shock. Then he pulled up his gun. . . . Then he shot like three times and hit Sticks.&#34; Orebo, mortally wounded, punched the accelerator. The car lurched into a wall and caught fire. Orebo, a dropout and the father of a 4-year-old son, had planned to get married the next month and become an auto mechanic, said his mother, Georgia Alfred. He had been jailed a couple of times for traffic tickets and other small offenses, she said. &#34;But nothing violent. No guns or anything like that.&#34; Alfred said her son and Williams watched the verdicts in the King beating case together and were angry, &#34;but he wasn&#39;t going out beating anyone or carrying a gun.&#34; &#34;From what I gathered, my son didn&#39;t know [Williams] had the gun until he pulled it up,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m angry, but I&#39;m angry with the young man.&#34;</p>
