    <h1>Aaron Ratinoff, a 68 year old, White male died on 1992-05-01
in a homicide at 11690 Gateway Blvd. in Sawtelle.</h1>

    <p>Aaron Ratinoff, a 68-year-old white man, died Friday, May 1, 1992, in the 11600 block of Gateway Boulevard in Sawtelle. Ratinoff was strangled by a supermarket produce manager in a dispute over corn husks. Ratinoff would never have ended up at the Bob&#39;s Market on Gateway Boulevard in West Los Angeles if the store where he normally shopped had remained open during the riots. The produce manager apparently got angry when Ratinoff dropped some corn husks on the floor while shopping for vegetables, and the pair tussled. Coroner&#39;s spokesman Bob Dambacher said the criterion his office has used for riot-related deaths was simple: &#34;Would this person have died at that particular time and that particular place if the riots had not occurred?&#34;</p>
