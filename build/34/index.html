    <h1>Howard Eugene Martin, a 22 year old, black male died on 1992-05-03
in a officer involved shooting at near North Los Robles Avenue &amp; Claremont Street in Pasadena.</h1>

    <p>Howard Eugene Martin, a 22-year-old black man, was shot and killed Sunday, May 3, 1992, near the intersection of North Los Robles Avenue and Claremont Street in Pasadena. He was known as &#34;Nine Lives.&#34; Twice in the last five years, Martin had been a passenger in cars where the driver was killed. Once, it was a late-night automobile crash. The other time a friend was shot in the head by masked gunmen. &#34;The boy just fell into Howard&#39;s lap,&#34; recalls his sister, Wanda. Martin&#39;s luck finally ran out three days after the verdicts in the King beating case. The father of three, who grew up only a couple of blocks from King, was killed by a stray bullet. The incident began, police said, when two officers tried to disperse more than 150 party-goers at a Pasadena apartment complex but were greeted with rocks and bottles -- and gunshots. Nearly 25 more officers arrived quickly, and 10 of them fired a total of 70 rounds at several assailants. Martin, relatives said, was visiting friends at a nearby apartment when he stepped onto a balcony to look at what was going on. He was struck in the head by a police bullet that apparently ricocheted off the street, police said. Martin&#39;s sister and other relatives said police should have shown more control over their gunfire. &#34;They probably felt they were under attack,&#34; she said. &#34;But that doesn&#39;t justify firing 70 rounds.&#34;</p>
