    <h1>Carol Benson, a 42 year old, Black female died on 1992-05-02
in a death at Harbor Freeway near Slauson Avenue in South Park.</h1>

    <p>Carol Benson, a 42-year-old black woman, was struck on the 110 Freeway near Slauson Avenue in a hit-and-run accident on Saturday, May 2, 1992. Little is known about Benson, who was struck and dragged 180 feet. Authorities say she lived by herself in an apartment across from a small church in South Los Angeles. No relatives claimed her body, so her funeral was like those offered for all indigents: a cremation at County-USC Medical Center.</p>
