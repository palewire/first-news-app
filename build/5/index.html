<p>Vivian Austin, an 87-year-old black woman, died Sunday, May 3, 1992, in the 1600 block of West 60th Street. Austin suffered a fatal heart attack at her home in Harvard Park. Friends said she had been distraught by the rioting. &#34;This is considered a riot case because the stress from the riot was well documented and is a contributing factor in death from arteriosclerotic disease,&#34; the coroner&#39;s report says.</p>
